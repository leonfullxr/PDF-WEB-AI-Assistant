# PDF-WEB-AI-Assistant
A tool designed to extract and synthesize information from web and PDF sources, it employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to provide accurate, context-rich responses to user queries.

## Technical Workflow:

* **Data Acquisition:** Harnesses LangChain's UnstructuredURLLoader and PdfReader for efficient data extraction from multiple URLs and PDFs.
* **Content Segmentation:** Strategically segments large texts into manageable chunks, optimizing both computational resources and data relevancy.
* **Vector Embedding and Storage:** Transforms text segments into mathematical vectors using OpenAIEmbeddings, storing them in a FAISS vector database for rapid, similarity-based retrieval.
* **Semantic Query Processing:** When a query is received, the system identifies the most relevant text vectors, pulling contextually appropriate information for response generation.
* **AI-Driven Generation:** The OpenAI LLM processes the retrieved information, crafting responses that are precise, contextually enriched, and human-like in their articulation.
* **Automated PDF Summarization:** Evaluates entire PDFs to produce summaries that capture essential details, providing a quick digest of extensive materials.
